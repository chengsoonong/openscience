# Moats in Research and Development
*Ideas about what stops open science.*

## Key idea
The opposite of open is a moat. We should be thinking about the second order
effects of scientific reform. How can a particular policy be used to create
barriers to entry? Which policy has resulted in an exacerbation of inequality?
What are the ways openness can be used to prevent knowledge dissemination?

## The problem
- Language is a moat. Much of recent scientific literature is published in English.
  It is a moat to dissemination of information in open access articles, for
  non-English readers. It is a moat used by reviewers to reject papers, dismissing
  valuable ideas by saying "please get a native English speaker to fix grammar".
- Jargon is a moat. As the proliferation of scientific fields grow, each field
  becomes increasingly niche in its language.
- Compute infrastructure is a moat. For example the large language models of
  machine learning can now only be trained by a handful of companies in the world.
  Even though the models may be open source, and the data (neural network weights)
  freely available, most academic researchers do not have the bandwidth nor
  the local storage and compute to execute them.
- Article processing charges is a moat. Nature has an
  [open access track](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03324-y) with APC
  of almost 10 thousand euros. This is an annual salary for many research
  institutions.
- Open source contributors need other jobs to pay their bills. This limits the
  contributors to only those with privilege.
- Conference travel is a moat. As the global pandemic has forced many conferences
  to be virtual, the participation of traditionally marginalised people has
  increased.
- Study pre-registration is a moat. Only well funded labs have the luxury to
  document all their ideas. Given the adversity to risky blue sky research
  (e.g. in ARC in Australia), only "safe" studies are declared.
- Competitive grants are a moat. As success rates for academic grants are
  in the 10% range, academics are spending a quarter of their year writing
  proposals, continuing the mental stress of precarious employment.
- Open standards are moats. For low resourced organisations, trying to implement
  all the necessary elements to satisfy a standard may be too onerous.
- Metrics that measure openness can be moats. Look at 
  [Campbell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law) and
  [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).


## The opportunity

- Science communication.
- Economic benefits to open science.
