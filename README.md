# Moats in Research and Development
*Ideas about what stops open science.*

## Key idea
The opposite of open is a moat. We should be thinking about the second order
effects of scientific reform. How can a particular policy be used to create
barriers to entry? Which policy has resulted in an exacerbation of inequality?
What are the ways openness can be used to prevent knowledge dissemination?

## Background
The narrative to date in relation to science policy is that, over time, we have gone from closed access to open access.
However, the Open Science movement has not yielded the kind of scientific utopia that was anticipated.
Somehow, each well-intentioned Open Science initiative is susceptible to being subverted to protect the status-quo. E.g. pre-registration is considered a good thing. However, it can be used by large institutions to block smaller institutions from doing the experiment. So it is an inadvertent moat of open science? Is it a necessity for any moat to protect open science at all?
If the existing approach to Open Science continues, what is the next step in this narrative? How do we avoid the Open Science movement giving rise to a scientific community defined by moat-access? (not quite going back to closed access, but nevertheless preventing people from participating in scholarly pursuits). 

## Moats as defence or obstacle 
The term 'Moat' is intended to refer to a blocker to the realisation of 'Open Science'. In this sense a moat is blocker or a barrier to access.
However, a moat can also be seen as a necessary defensive measure that protects Open Science. 
Whether or not one considers a moat to be an obstacle or a necessary means of protection depends on which side of the moat you are on.
The focus of this paper is to scrutinise Open Science policy reforms, with a view to identifying those reforms which have resulted in the second-order impacts that are antithetical to their original intent and operate effectively as blockers or moats to Open Science. 

## (?) Open-Science as Camelot (?)
The metaphor of the moat and its potential to function as both a protective and exclusionary force, has been expanded to consider what lies at the centre of the moat? That is, what is it protecting or excluding-access to? The answer, of course, is Open Science - arguably a Camelot type ideal defined by UNESCO as:

  _"an inclusive construct that combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual scientific knowledge openly  available,        accessible  and  reusable  for  everyone,  to  increase  scientific  collaborations  and  sharing of information for the benefits of science and society, and to open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community. It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science communication, open engagement of societal actors and open dialogue with other knowledge systems."_

As a 'kingdom', how does Open-Science use moats to protect its noble ideals, while avoiding those same moats becoming exclusionary barriers that cut-it off from the wider-world it seeks to influence and engage with? What are the second-order consequences that shift moats from being protective to exclusionary landforms? 

  ## If the metaphor of the moat is not serving our purposes, what is an alternative? 

## The problem - examples of Moats to Open Science/Open Science Moats
- Language is a moat. Much of recent scientific literature is published in English.
  It is a moat to dissemination of information in open access articles, for
  non-English readers. It is a moat used by reviewers to reject papers, dismissing
  valuable ideas by saying "please get a native English speaker to fix grammar".
- Jargon is a moat. As the proliferation of scientific fields grow, each field
  becomes increasingly niche in its language.
- Compute infrastructure is a moat. For example the large language models of
  machine learning can now only be trained by a handful of companies in the world.
  Even though the models may be open source, and the data (neural network weights)
  freely available, most academic researchers do not have the bandwidth nor
  the local storage and compute to execute them.
- Article processing charges is a moat. Nature has an
  [open access track](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03324-y) with APC
  of almost 10 thousand euros. This is an annual salary for many research
  institutions.
- Open source contributors need other jobs to pay their bills. This limits the
  contributors to only those with privilege.
- Conference travel is a moat. As the global pandemic has forced many conferences
  to be virtual, the participation of traditionally marginalised people has
  increased.
- Study pre-registration is a moat. Only well funded labs have the luxury to
  document all their ideas. Given the adversity to risky blue sky research
  (e.g. in ARC in Australia), only "safe" studies are declared.
- Competitive grants are a moat. As success rates for academic grants are
  in the 10% range, academics are spending a quarter of their year writing
  proposals, continuing the mental stress of precarious employment.
- Open standards are moats. For low resourced organisations, trying to implement
  all the necessary elements to satisfy a standard may be too onerous.
- Metrics that measure openness can be moats. Look at 
  [Campbell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law) and
  [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).

## Second Order Consequences of Open Science - an example from the Covid-19 Pandemic
The ongoing Covid pandemic has revealed a number of unintended consequences of Open Science policies. 

For example, Open-Science policy of post-publication peer review has been responsible for fuelling and arguably initiating consipiracy theories and misinformation about the origins of the virus and potential treatments for it (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1050651920958506). For example, on January 31, 2020 a preprint at the website bioRxiv, suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was genetically engineered because the team found similarities between this virus and HIV (Pradhan et al., 2020). While this research was roundly criticised and condemned by the broader scientific community (a response was published 3 months later), it fuelled conspiracy theories about the covid-19 virus being lab grown in China. 

In this example, we can how the Open-Science idea of post-publication peer review can result in shoddy research capturing the public attention, leading to mistrust in scientific research, conspiracy theories and cherry-picking of research to support political ends. These are second-order consequences of significant concern. A relevant factor in this space is the role that the internet and social-media platforms play in allowing misinformation, taken from Open-Science sources, to spread. While complaining about the undesirable influence of social-media platforms is nothing new and noting that connectivity is core consideration of the Open-Science movement, is there a need to reconsider how Open-Science operates in the _type_ of connectivity that exists today? 

Thinking about this example of second order consequences of Open Science, raises the possibility of exploring how Open Science policies need to consider what it means in practice to be 'Open'. That is, by increasing public access to scientific discoveries and the scientific process (including non-peer reviewed publications), what obligations are placed on the scientific community to be cognisant of the technological, political and social ecosystems into which they are releasing information _and_ what measures must they take to ensure responsible use of this information? Are there certain 'pillars' or 'principles' which the science community must observe in an 'open science' practice - such as rigour, stewardship/on-going responsibility for research that is put out into the world? In the article referred to above by Amy Koerber, she stresses the importance of communication:

"_In an age where information can circulate more widely and quickly than we previously would have thought possible, no one can afford to cling to a belief that the communication of scientific knowledge is separate from the production of that knowledge._"


## The opportunity

- Science communication.
- Economic benefits to open science.
